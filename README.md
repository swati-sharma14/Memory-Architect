# Memory Architect 	üß†

This program helps users understand and visualize the organization of memory within a computer system. It provides information about different types of memory and allows users to solve various memory-related questions.

## Types of Memory üìö

1. Bit Addressable Memory - Cell Size = 1 bit
2. Nibble Addressable Memory - Cell Size = 4 bits
3. Byte Addressable Memory - Cell Size = 8 bits (standard)
4. Word Addressable Memory - Cell Size = Word Size (depends on CPU)

Note: Byte Addressable Memory is the industry standard unless otherwise mentioned.

Important Note: CPUs are always word addressable, which means the number of bits in a CPU represents its word size. An interface is required to connect the CPU with memory.

## Memory Architect CLI üíª

The Memory Architect CLI is a command-line program that allows users to input information and interact with the memory-related features.

### Queries ‚ùì

The program supports processing different types of memory-related queries:

1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and Instructions:
   - Type A Query: `<Q bit opcode> <P-bit address> <7 bit register>`
   - Type B Query: `<Q bit opcode> <R bits filler> <7 bit register> <7 bit register>`

For each type of query, the following information should be provided as input:

- Length of one instruction in bits
- Length of a register in bits

The program will output the following information:

- Minimum number of bits needed to represent an address in this architecture
- Number of bits needed for the opcode
- Number of filler bits in Type B instruction
- Maximum number of instructions supported by this ISA
- Maximum number of registers supported by this ISA

2. System Enhancement Queries:
   - Type 1 Query:
     - Number of bits in the CPU
     - Desired change in the current addressable memory to any of the three remaining options

   Output:
   - Number of address pins saved or required (indicated by "-" for saved pins and "+" for additional pins)
   - Note: The memory size and current addressability are carried over from the initial inputs.

   - Type 2 Query:
     - Number of bits in the CPU
     - Number of address pins available in the CPU
     - Type of addressable memory (choose one of the four options)

   Output:
   - Maximum size of the main memory in bytes (excluding the initial inputs of addressability and memory space)

## Examples üåü

To understand the input format and how the program works, refer to the provided examples. They cover different types of queries and provide the expected output.
